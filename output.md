Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.
"America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation," he said.
There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. 
Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.
In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. 
Zelensky said "difficult issues remained difficult", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.
He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned "preparatory elements are needed for this". 
Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: "The Americans say that they want to do everything by June." 
"Why before this summer?" he added. "We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact." These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.

As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. 
"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities," Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. 
Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that "form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.
Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said "the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased" as a result of the latest attacks. 
Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.
Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.
"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations," he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.
In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. 
At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.

The Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region. 
DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth "massive attack" on its power plants since October 2025.
"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion," the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. 
One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and "critical infrastructure".
In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: "They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity." 
A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (62 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. 
Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. 
Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said. 
Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks. 
[Moscow renewed its attacks](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwng25114ro) on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.
DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused "the most powerful blow" to infrastructure so far this year. 
"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine," Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.
Russia has also accused Kyiv of not being serious about securing a lasting peace. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday blamed Ukraine for the [shooting of a high-profile general in Russia's military](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3686nzexp3o), saying it was aimed at "disrupting the negotiation process".
It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.
